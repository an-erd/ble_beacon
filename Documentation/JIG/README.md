# Beacon JIG to program Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons

## Mount 

The mount to hold the PCB and the test needles to program the beacon are cut with a laser from a 4 mm Acrylic GS
clear, transparent material. There are several services available.

The design used are in the files "P1_beacon_jig_MOUNT.svg". I use the right column of the design, i.e. a base plate, two plates which hold the PCB, and two top plates which hold the test needles.

Remark: In the design there is one top plate missing, use one of the other plates with a wrong diameter, and enlarge the holes a little with an appropriate drill.

For the test needles I use a product from PTR (Präzisionsprüfstif 1025/E-1.5N-AU-1.0), with a diameter of 1.37 mm. I found that a laser cut hole with a diameter of 1.21 mm works pretty well.

I use screws to fix the plates, while I glue the two bottom and the two top plates together, respectively. 

## PCB

The PCB is set on top of the test needles and is connected to the programming device.
